# Abstract

- The application of artificial intelligence by insurance companies might allow for a more accurate prediction of loss probabilities, thus reducing one of the industry’s most inherent problems, namely asymmetric information.

# Motivation and aim of the paper

- There is a growing consensus on the potential of artificial intelligence to transform modern economies and societies (Abrardi et al. 2019; Bolton et al. 2018; Boyd and Holton 2017; Makridakis 2017).
- There is a wide range of real-world use cases across industries. Among these are pattern and anomaly detection (e.g. for fraud mitigation, see e.g. Ahmed et al. 2016), speech recognition and natural language generation (e.g. for the development of chatbots, see e.g. Dale 2016), recommendation engines (e.g. for automated product suggestions, see e.g. Marchand and Marx 2020), image recognition (e.g. for improved public safety, see e.g. Zhang et al. 2016), and automated decision-making systems (e.g. for robo-advice, see e.g. Faloon and Scherer 2017).
- The insurance sector is lagging behind in the worldwide and intersectoral artificial intelligence movements (Rangwala et al. 2020; Deloitte 2017).
- Nevertheless, it is likely that artificial intelligence will have a broad impact along the insurance value chain, from underwriting and claims management over distribution and customer service to asset management. Consequently, insurance executives must understand the new technologies that will contribute to this change and how artificial intelligence can help organisations create innovative products, glean valuable insights from new data sources, streamline business processes and improve customer service.
- The intention of this paper is to support practitioners in understanding the potential benefits associated with artificial intelligence applications and to motivate academics to study this multifaceted, controversial and heavily under-researched topic.
- Towards this end, we establish a database of papers and industry studies on the use of artificial intelligence in the insurance sector and systematically evaluate the impact of artificial intelligence along Porter’s (1985) value chain and on Berliner’s (1982) insurability criteria.

# Survey of existing knowledge on artificial intelligence in insurance

- The ubiquity of mobile and interconnected devices exponentially increased the availability of customer data. […] Access to the vast amount of customer data forms the basis for numerous artificial intelligence applications and can be considered a precondition for the implementation of artificial intelligence by insurance companies.

## What is artificial intelligence and which technologies will influence the insurance industry?

- Conversion of language or text:
    - chatbots to respond to written or verbal customer requests (e.g. Lemonade, Allianz, PNB MetLife, AXA, Aetna, Geico)
    - sort and classify incoming customer mails (Versicherungskammer Bayern)
    - detecting and analysing emotions in written or verbal customer feedback to improve customer satisfaction and retention
- Recognition of patterns, trends and preferences:
    - automatic detection of fraudulent claims (e.g. Oscar, Fabric, Aegon, Ping An, AXA, Generali, Allianz)
    - innovative and personalised usage-based insurance products (e.g. MetroMile, Progressive, State Farm, Allianz, John Hancock, Generali)
- Content-based processing of information and data-driven decision making
    - video and image analysis from satellite pictures to provide early warning systems for natural catastrophes (Swiss Re)
    - biometrics authorisation application for the automatic identification of users (ManuLife)
    - automated asset management and asset allocation (Basler Versicherungen in cooperation with Deutsche AM, and Helvetia Versicherungen in cooperation with MoneyPark)²

## What is the impact of artificial intelligence along the insurance value chain?

- A higher accuracy for administrative repetitive tasks can be achieved by eliminating human errors.
- One major challenge with the use of big data and artificial intelligence in this context is the accompanying ethical and legal issues. These include discussions about the extent to which insurers are allowed to use all of the generated data for decision making, how long the data has to be retained and which actions insurers must take to protect the data against, for instance, cybercrime (Hussain and Prieto 2016).
- The third category includes fundamental changes in insurance markets, which have not been discussed so far. […] The development of artificial intelligence will not only create new insurance markets and new risks but also cause certain existing markets to disappear (The Geneva Association 2018). One obvious example is autonomous driving, which changes the nature of liability in the automotive industry. Who is liable in case of an accident: the passenger, the car manufacturer or the software developer of the artificial intelligence algorithms? This development questions whether traditional car insurance, as we know it today, will still exist in the future.

## How does artificial intelligence influence the insurability of risks?

- The application of artificial intelligence by insurers does not compromise but rather improves the insurability of risks. […] The only exception is […] public policy, which remains unclear as the application of artificial intelligence implies increased transparency of policyholders’ sensitive data, which potentially raises ethical and moral questions.

## Changes in risks triggered by artificial intelligence

- The insurance market of the future will be shaped by numerous everyday artificial intelligence applications. […] This development will have a significant impact on the risk landscape. […] Artificial intelligence applications have the potential to transform the nature of loss events. […] Given the example of autonomous driving, the total number of accidents is likely to be considerably reduced, implying much lower loss probabilities. […] However, a breakdown of the underlying artificial intelligence system or a hacking attack can cause a cascading series of accidents resulting in a considerable increase in the maximum possible loss. Hence, loss events are not independent due to increasing connectedness […] and the shift from high-frequency/low-severity to low-frequency/high-severity risks.
- Accumulation risk (the problem of emerging dependencies of risks through increasing interconnectedness) poses a major hurdle to the insurability of cyber risks (Biener et al., 2015). […] A potential way to reduce accumulation risk and ensure sufficient independency of loss events could be the diversification of applied artificial intelligence systems.

# Summary and derivation of potential future work

- The changes in asymmetry of information and the associated economic welfare effects are intriguing. […] Linked to this is the question regarding the value of data from the customer’s and provider’s points of view.
- Will self-driving vehicles and health nanobots transform risks to the extent that the traditional idea of insurance comes into question? Will the public perception and brand image of insurance  companies suffer as people become uncomfortable with constant surveillance? Will increased transparency and usage-based pricing lead to less solidarity in the context of social insurance? Will this lead to social unrest if high-risk policyholders can no longer afford insurance?
